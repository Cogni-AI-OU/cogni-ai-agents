# GitHub Workflows and Actions

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows, agent prompts, and related configuration.

- For the agent-facing workflow catalog, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- Workflow templates that are not active live in `../workflow-templates/`.

## Workflows

### Check Workflow (`check.yml`)

The `check.yml` workflow runs on pull requests, pushes, scheduled cadence, and bot-driven workflow runs to
ensure code quality and correctness.

Jobs:

- **actionlint**: Validates GitHub Actions workflow files.
- **link-checker**: Checks for broken links in Markdown files using Lychee.
- **pre-commit**: Runs pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting.

#### Link Checker

The link checker job uses [Lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) to scan all Markdown files for broken links.
It includes caching to avoid rate limits and can be configured via `.lycheeignore` at the repository root to exclude
specific URLs or patterns.

**Local Testing**: You can test links locally with the configured `markdown-link-check` pre-commit hook:

```bash
# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r .devcontainer/requirements.txt

# Check a single file
pre-commit run markdown-link-check --files path/to/file.md

# Check all Markdown files
pre-commit run markdown-link-check -a
```

The hook uses `.markdown-link-check.json` and checks both local file references and remote URLs before you push changes.

#### Using Check as a Reusable Workflow

You can use the Check workflow in another repository by referencing it via `workflow_call`:

```yaml
---
name: Check
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * 1  # Run every Monday at 00:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  check:
    uses: Cogni-AI-OU/.github/.github/workflows/check.yml@main
    with:
      submodules: 'false'  # Set to 'true' or 'recursive' if repository uses submodules
```

### Cogni AI Agent Workflow (`cogni-ai-agent.yml`)

The `cogni-ai-agent.yml` workflow enables the Cogni AI Agent. It runs on issue comments, pull request review comments,
and manual triggers (`workflow_dispatch`). The workflow installs Python dependencies from `.devcontainer/requirements.txt`
and invokes `Cogni-AI-OU/cogni-ai-agent-action` to process natural-language instructions, automate repository tasks,
and report back status updates.

### Copilot Setup Steps Workflow (`copilot-setup-steps.yml`)

The `copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow is a utility helper that checks out the repository, sets up Python 3.12,
restores the Python user-site cache, and installs dependencies from `.devcontainer/requirements.txt`. It is triggered on
pushes and pull requests that modify the workflow file or dependency manifest, and can be reused by other repositories to
mirror the setup steps.

### Devcontainer CI Workflow (`devcontainer-ci.yml`)

The `devcontainer-ci.yml` workflow builds and tests the development container image.

**Purpose**: It ensures that all required command-line tools (e.g., `docker`, `gh`, `pre-commit`) and Python packages
(e.g., `ansible-lint`, `molecule`) are properly installed and functional inside the devcontainer. It runs on changes to the
`.devcontainer` directory, on a weekly schedule, and can also be used as a reusable workflow (requires `packages: write`
permission for the caller).

#### Using Devcontainer CI as a Reusable Workflow

```yaml
jobs:
  devcontainer:
    uses: Cogni-AI-OU/.github/.github/workflows/devcontainer-ci.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write  # Required for pushing to GitHub Container Registry
```

### OpenCode Workflow (`opencode.yml`)

The `opencode.yml` workflow provides OpenCode automation for AI-assisted development, including slash-command and
manual triggers.

#### Using OpenCode as a Reusable Workflow

Reference it via `workflow_call` or `workflow_dispatch` to leverage the same automation:

```yaml
---
name: OpenCode
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      agent:
        description: Agent to use.
        required: false
        type: string
      model:
        description: Model to use for OpenCode
        required: false
        type: string
      issue_number:
        description: Issue or PR number for workflow_call triggers
        required: false
        type: number
      prompt:
        description: Custom prompt to override the default prompt
        required: false
        type: string
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      agent:
        description: Agent to use.
        required: false
        type: string
      model:
        description: Model to use for OpenCode
        required: false
        type: string
      issue_number:
        description: Issue or PR number for manual workflow execution
        required: false
        type: number
      prompt:
        description: Custom prompt to override the default prompt
        required: false
        type: string
jobs:
  opencode:
    uses: Cogni-AI-OU/.github/.github/workflows/opencode.yml@main
    with:
      agent: >-
        ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || github.event_name == 'workflow_call') && inputs.agent }}
      model: >-
        ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || github.event_name == 'workflow_call') && inputs.model }}
      prompt: >-
        ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || github.event_name == 'workflow_call') && inputs.prompt }}
      issue_number: >-
        ${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number || inputs.issue_number }}
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: write
      id-token: write
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
    secrets: inherit
```

*Note: Requires the `OPENCODE_API_KEY` secret and the [GitHub OpenCode app](https://github.com/apps/opencode-agent)
installation (or manual setup per the [OpenCode docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/github/#manual-setup)).*

## Workflow Templates

The `../workflow-templates/` directory contains reference workflows that are not actively executed but are preserved for
future use or copying to other repositories. These templates can be customized and moved to the `workflows/` directory
when needed.

## Agent Prompts and Catalogs

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md): Agent-facing catalog for workflows in this directory.
- [`../agents/`](../agents/): Primary Cogni agent definitions consumed by OpenCode.

## MCP Configuration

The `../mcp-config.json` configuration provides GitHub Copilot access to built-in tools:

- **Repository & Code:** `get_file_contents`, `search_code`, `search_repositories`, `list_branches`, `list_commits`
- **Issues & PRs:** `get_issue`, `list_pull_requests`, `create_pull_request`
- **Actions:** `list_workflows`, `list_workflow_runs`, `get_job_logs`

## Problem Matchers

GitHub Actions problem matchers automatically annotate files with errors and warnings in pull requests, making it easier
to identify and fix issues.

### Available Matchers

- **actionlint-matcher.json**: Captures errors from actionlint workflow linting.
- **pre-commit-matcher.json**: Captures errors from pre-commit hooks.

### Pre-commit Problem Matcher

The pre-commit problem matcher supports two output formats:

1. **Generic format** (`file:line:col: message`): Used by flake8, actionlint, and other tools that provide column
   information.
2. **No-column format** (`file:line message`): Used by markdownlint and other tools that only provide line numbers.

Note: Some hooks like yamllint and ansible-lint already output GitHub Actions annotations directly and don't need the
problem matcher.

### Configuration

Problem matchers are registered in the `check.yml` workflow before running the corresponding tools. When using
`check.yml` as a reusable workflow, the matcher files are automatically provided from this repository. You can override
them by providing custom paths via workflow inputs (`actionlint-matcher-path`, `pre-commit-matcher-path`).

## Security

### OpenCode Workflow Git Access

The OpenCode workflow (`opencode.yml`) grants intentionally broad git access via `Bash(git:*)` to enable autonomous code
changes. This permission is necessary for OpenCode to commit and push changes, but it requires proper safeguards.

#### Security Controls

**Access Control:**

- Only trusted users can trigger OpenCode (OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR, CONTRIBUTOR).
- PR/issue authors can only trigger on their own content.
- External contributors (FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR, NONE) are explicitly blocked.

**Required Repository Protections:**

To safely use OpenCode with git access, repository administrators must configure:

1. **Branch Protection Rules** on main/protected branches:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging.
   - Require status checks to pass (e.g., linting, tests).
   - Require conversation resolution before merging.
   - Do not allow bypassing the above settings.

2. **GitHub Audit Logs** (organization-level):
   - Enable and regularly review audit logs.
   - Monitor commits made by `github-actions[bot]` (OpenCode's identity).
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns (rapid commits, deleted branches, etc.).

3. **Protected Branch Policies**:
   - Restrict who can push to protected branches.
   - Consider requiring deployment approvals for production branches.
   - Use CODEOWNERS to require specific reviewer approval for sensitive files.

#### Best Practices

- Review OpenCode's commits before merging PRs.
- Use draft PRs for OpenCode's work to require explicit promotion.
- Regularly audit OpenCode's tool usage and permissions.
- Rotate `OPENCODE_API_KEY` periodically.
- Monitor workflow run logs for unexpected behavior.

## OpenCode Tools

When operating via OpenCode in the GitHub Actions runtime, the following MCP tools are available and should be utilized
to perform tasks effectively:

- **vscode**: `getProjectSetupInfo`, `installExtension`, `memory`, `newWorkspace`, `resolveMemoryFileUri`,
  `runCommand`, `vscodeAPI`, `extensions`, `askQuestions`
- **execute**: `runNotebookCell`, `testFailure`, `getTerminalOutput`, `killTerminal`, `sendToTerminal`,
  `createAndRunTask`, `runInTerminal`
- **read**: `getNotebookSummary`, `problems`, `readFile`, `viewImage`, `terminalSelection`, `terminalLastCommand`
- **edit**: `createDirectory`, `createFile`, `createJupyterNotebook`, `editFiles`, `editNotebook`, `rename`
- **search**: `changes`, `codebase`, `fileSearch`, `listDirectory`, `textSearch`, `usages`
- **web**: `fetch`, `githubRepo`
- **browser**: `openBrowserPage`
- **agent**: `runSubagent`
- **misc**: `vscode.mermaid-chat-features/renderMermaidDiagram`, `ms-python.python/getPythonEnvironmentInfo`,
  `ms-python.python/getPythonExecutableCommand`, `ms-python.python/installPythonPackage`, `todo`

In addition to the MCP integrations, the agent runtime provides a set of core built-in capabilities (often logged as
`Glob`, `Todo`/`TodoWrite`, `Edit`, etc.). These are executed directly by the agent's core engine, rather than through
the OpenCode MCP protocol, and include file system access, editing, and shell execution primitives.
